      Today I met a {top} who goes by {name}. {capatialize(subj)}
      {#if plural}have{:else}has{/if} a wonderful personality. That smile of {poss} really makes me happy. I could talk to
      {obj} all day although {subj}
      {#if plural}don't{:else}dosen't{/if} talk about {refl} much. I wonder if {possDeter}
      day has been wonderful. I hope so!

      Oh, did you hear about {name}â€™s newest creation? {capatialize(subj)} made a beautiful painting of a campground that
      {possDeter} family took {obj} to back when {subj}
      {#if plural}were{:else}was{/if} a child. {name} is sooo talented, I wish I was {obj}.

      Did you see that one {top}'s new haircut? I think {possDeter} name is {name}. It's really impressive considering {subj}
      cut it {refl}.
